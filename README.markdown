**Note:** Only the Octopress shell and blog content are currently committed. I'm trying to figure out the best way to include just the photos currently published (as opposed to every photo that I have in my assets directory).

If you need a full-size version of a photo, each photo in the book should have a Flickr link that provides the full-size version.
