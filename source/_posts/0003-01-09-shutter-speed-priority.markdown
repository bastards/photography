Shutter speed is one of [the three ways to adjust exposure level]({%postpath big-picture-of-exposure%}#bigchart). 

In my opinion, it is the most important way to control exposure because when it is too slow, you'll likely have an image that is unusable.

Hopefully you got used to Program mode, at least the part where you were manually adjusting the exposure level. We're going to learn the **Shutter Priority** mode which gives you one more variable to worry about. But after you master it, you probably won't use Program mode again.

Among the shooting modes in your camera menu, either **Tv** or **S** should stand for "**Shutter Priority**" This lets you pick a specific shutter speed while the camera adjusts the two other settings (aperture and ISO) to maintain the set exposure level.

How you adjust the shutter speed should be similar to how you adjusted the exposure compensation: using some kind of dial or menu. It varies for each camera.


## When should I go to shutter priority mode?
Whenever you need to sharply capture motion; this includes still objects that may appear to shake because of the camera's movement.

If you want to deliberately capture motion blur, then shutter priority mode is used to jack up the number of seconds for the shutter to stay open.


## How do I capture motion blur?
By increasing how long the shutter stays open, i.e. decreasing the shutter <em>speed</em>. How long you do this depends on how fast the motion is. The slower the shutter speed, the longer the light trail.

		Sixth Avenue and 49th Street, in Midtown Manhattan. The shutter speed here is relatively fast, allowing the non-moving objects (the buildings) to remain sharp as I hand-hold the camera. However, traffic is moving very fast in relative to my position, leaving a light trail.

### Walking around
I chose to cover shutter priority mode as our first manual mode because it's the easiest to deal with. 

In any given situation, you don't want the shutter speed to fall below **1/50th** of a second. Any slower and it's hard to guarantee a clean shot (even at 1/50s, there's a good chance for blur).

You'll see in  [aperture-priority mode]({%postpath aperture%}), the opposite case will arise. The aperture stays constant, so when you walk into a dark room, the camera will bring the shutter speed to a speed so slow that you'll be unable to shoot a steady image.
