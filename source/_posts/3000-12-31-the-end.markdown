Congratulations, you've reached the end of what I've written for the Bastards Book of Photography...so far.

<!--more-->

I want to keep this book short and to its original goal &ndash; a quick guide on how to use your camera's manual controls &ndash; but there's plenty of topics to cover, including:

* Ambient light versus direct light
* Focus
* Focus selection
* Focal length and perspective
* The use of flash
* Post-processing
* Some tips on street photography and portraiture




I also have a few interactive features I plan to add to make the lessons more useful.

At the very least, I can keep adding photos.
